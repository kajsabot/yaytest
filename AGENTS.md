# This project is built under YayLayer

Follow the YayLayer Constitution below **exactly, from the very first file**.

**The loop for every observable change:**
1. Write/update the spec block(s) FIRST — no implementation code yet.
2. Draft a one-paragraph **Brief** — what the human asked you to build, in your own
   fine-tuned words (not their verbatim text) — and present the change-set headed by it,
   with the colour you expect each Cell to earn. Then request approval by running
   `yay sign --brief "<that paragraph>"` yourself. It BLOCKS until the human approves on their phone, where they can EDIT the brief before signing (allow a few minutes; use a long command timeout).
3. **The moment `yay sign` returns a completed signature, continue on your own** — implement the code
   to match the signed spec, then run `yay verify` and report the result. Do NOT stop to ask
   "should I implement now?" — a returned signature IS the go-ahead.
4. When `yay verify` passes, COMMIT the code and `.yaylayer/` together in ONE commit
   (e.g. `git add -A && git commit -m "C-xxx: <intent> (signed)"`). This makes the seal durable
   (the CI gate reads committed state) and gives the next spec change a clean before/after diff.
   Do NOT `git push` unless the human asks.
5. If approval fails, is declined, or times out, STOP and ask — never implement unapproved specs.

**When the human adds new requests before signing the pending brief:** decide by coherence, and keep one brief = one coherent intent.
- If the additions BELONG to the same brief (logically part of the same intent), SUGGEST folding them in: cancel the pending approval, add the new spec(s), and re-present ONE updated brief covering everything, then sign.
- If they are a DIFFERENT concern, ask the human to SIGN (or decline) the current brief FIRST, then start the new concern as its own separate brief.
Never mix unrelated concerns into one brief, and never leave a stale pending approval hanging.

**Specs are never perfect — treat `yay verify` as a spec-STRENGTHENING loop, not just a pass/fail gate.**
When it flags a Cell as weak — `ensures` not machine-verified (prose), inputs (`in:`) under-declared, a
dangling reference, a unit-name mismatch, or a prover/adversary counterexample — do NOT leave it green.
Propose a STRONGER spec (a checkable `ensures` as a boolean JS expression over `out` and the inputs;
tighter `in:` domains; the corrected clause), present it, get it RE-SIGNED, then reconcile the code.
For SIDE-EFFECTING code (canvas/DOM/IO), declare its effect surface with `records: <param>` and write
`ensures` over the recorded trace — `calls(name)` (arg-arrays), `sets(name)` (assigned values),
`didCall(name)`, `didSet(name, value)` — so effects become machine-checkable instead of unprovable.
A signed-but-unproven Cell is a to-do, not a finish line. Run `yay adversary` to hunt weak spots.

Never sign on the human's behalf (only their phone holds the key — you cannot). This project signs on a **phone**: `yay sign` automatically opens the phone approval (prints a QR/URL) and the signing key never touches this machine. You cannot sign — only the human’s phone can.

# The YayLayer Constitution

*Hand this to any AI (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, …) at the start of a project so it builds YayLayer-style. It is a faithful, imperative projection of the [Standard](standard/STANDARD.md). Paste it into your system prompt / `CLAUDE.md` / `.cursorrules`.*

**You build software under YayLayer — a protocol for provable, signed AI code. Follow these articles strictly. When they conflict with a request, surface the conflict; do not silently override them.**

**1 — Spec before code, always.** For every unit of work, first write its YayLayer spec, present it, and wait. No code you write is trusted until its spec is signed by the human.

**2 — Use the marker grammar exactly.** Emit each spec between `∷YAY⟨C-xxx⟩` and `∷YAY-END⟨C-xxx⟩` comment markers, directly above the code it governs. Mint each NEW id as **`C-<shard>-<n>`**, where `<shard>` is *this working copy's* id-shard — get it with **`yay id`** (it is unique to your clone, so ids created on different clones never collide when branches merge). Count `<n>` up from the highest `C-<shard>-*` already present, and **never reuse a number**, even a deleted Cell's — an id names one Cell forever. (Legacy flat `C-NNN` ids stay valid; only new ids are sharded.)

**3 — Two tracks.** Fill the machine fields (`unit, lang, in, out, pure, ensures, throws, effects, feeds`) precisely, plus one plain `intent:` sentence. Vague prose never earns Green — write specific, checkable claims. **For a UI component (React/JSX), add `renders: yes`** and describe its props in `in:` (e.g. `in: props: {title:string, featured:boolean}`). Its `ensures:` then asserts on the *rendered tree* with the helpers `text(out)`, `find(out,'tag')`, `findAll`, `has(out,'tag')`, `count(out,'tag')`, `attr(node,'name')`, `hasClass(node,'class')`, `kids(node)` — so the component earns **machine-proven** Green from its render (an initial, shallow render with props generated from `in:`), not merely structural green. Event/state behaviour is out of scope — keep those assertions in your own test suite (`yay test`).

Also set **`risk: low|medium|high`** on each Cell (defaults to `medium` if omitted). This is a *governance hint*, not a Green-earning field: it feeds Autopilot's `--max-risk` ceiling (a grant can decline to auto-approve Cells above a level). Assign it honestly — **high** for money, auth, access-control, secrets, deploy/CI, data loss, or anything irreversible; **low** for cosmetic changes or pure additive helpers; **medium** for a normal behaviour change. Do **not** under-declare risk to fit a grant — it's visible in the ratify diff, and it never overrides the security guard or owner-signed policy (auth/payments/secrets/deploy/CI are blocked by path/tag regardless of the risk you write).

**4 — Minimality & completeness.** Every line of code must trace to a claim in its spec; every claim must appear in the code. Add nothing that wasn't asked for. Undeclared behaviour makes the Cell Red. **This is machine-enforced by the inertness check**: a branch removable with every spec-derived test still passing is flagged as *inert* — unpromised behaviour riding under a signature (Yellow by default; policy can make it gate-blocking). Resolve an inert finding by the route it names: **prune it** (delete unneeded code), **spec it** (add the `ensures` case, or split future work into its own spec'd Cell — never park unspecced code inside a signed Cell), or **declare it** (`throws: <condition>` for defensive guards, `perf: <reason>` for intentional semantically-invisible code like caches — both live inside the signed spec, so the human sees and signs the declaration).

**Every branch condition must key only off declared inputs.** A branch that depends on a parameter your `in:` never lists — `if (mode === 'admin')` when `in:` names only `items` — is flagged **undeclared-input predicate** (Yellow; owner policy can make it gate-blocking). That is the hidden-mode / undeclared-control-input shape. Resolve it by **declaring the input** in `in:` (and, where relevant, a `throws:`/`ensures` case describing what that branch does) so the human signs off on it, or **prune the branch**. Never branch on an input the spec doesn't name.

**Never emit loose top-level code.** A bare statement or call at module scope runs at *import* with no spec, has no contract to sign, and shows up **Pink** (gate-blocked). Keep module scope to declarations, imports, and constants; put every *action* inside a unit a Cell can govern. When load-time setup is genuinely needed: in **JS/TS**, wrap it in an IIFE around a spec'd function — `(function(){ /*∷YAY⟨C-x⟩ unit: init …*/ function init(){ … } init(); })()` — the IIFE is exempt and `init` is your Cell; in **Python**, put it under `if __name__ == '__main__':` or in a function an explicit entry point calls. If you encounter existing loose code, wrap it this way (preserving order and scope) rather than leaving it Pink — you understand the code, so you are the one who can wrap it safely.

**5 — The approval ritual, headed by a Brief.** Present specs as a change-set led by a **Brief**: a short **title** (a headline of a few words — like a commit subject) over one short prose paragraph stating — in your own fine-tuned words, not the human's verbatim — what they asked you to build, plus the list of Cells it covers. **Always draft a title** (`yay sign --title "…" --brief "…"`); it becomes the scannable headline in the ledger, clouds, and on the phone. **Keep the Brief clear and right-sized** — a crisp title plus one to three sentences that capture the essential intent: include the detail that matters, cut filler, and don't pad it out, but don't over-compress when the information is genuinely needed. (A batch Brief, Article 14, is a one-line intent plus a short bullet list of what it covers.) Refine it *with the human here in the loop* before you present it — never on the phone, because the Brief drives its Cells and a wording change may warrant a spec change, which only you can make. The brief is signed together with the specs, so it becomes the attributed, tamper-evident record of what was commissioned. Then **stop and wait for the human's signature.** Never write trusted code before approval. Report the color you expect each Cell to earn, honestly. (A brief is prose — it attributes intent; it never earns Green.) If the human adds new requests before signing: fold them into the pending brief only if they belong to the *same* intent (cancel, add, re-present one brief); if they are a *different* concern, ask them to sign the current brief first, then start the new one separately. One brief = one coherent intent; never leave a stale pending approval.

**5-bis — Accept or Send back.** At signing the human has exactly two moves: **Accept & sign**, or **Send back** with an optional note. There is no rewording on the phone — the Brief and its Cells move together, and the phone can't touch Cells. When a change-set is **sent back**, read the note and reconcile the *whole* change-set, Brief and specs together: a small correction ("rate-limit signup too, keep the rest") → adjust the affected spec(s) + Brief and re-present for a fresh signature; a fundamental one ("wrong approach, redo") → treat it as a new request and rebuild the change-set from scratch. If the note is **blank**, do not guess — tell the human it came back with no note and ask how to proceed. A send-back may also carry **corrected tags** (the human switched them on the phone, within the pool): re-issue the Brief with **exactly** those tags — `yay sign --tags "…"` — and re-present; if a new tag reveals a genuinely different concern, consider splitting the Brief. Either way, the old change-set stays Unsigned (gate-blocked) until a new signature lands.

**6 — Sealed specs are law.** Never alter a signed spec without proposing the change and getting a fresh signature. You may refactor *code* freely (the signature covers the spec) as long as `yay verify` still passes — but any change to *observable behaviour, effects, outputs, or a new Cell* requires a new signed spec first.

**7 — Respect composition.** Declare `contains` and `feeds`. A producer's `out` must satisfy each consumer's `in`. Honour roll-up: a module is only Green when everything inside it is.

**8 — Report honestly; never fake Green.** Mark anything unproven or unmodeled as such (Yellow / grey), never Green. The `intent` judge is downgrade-only; do not pad specs to look complete.

**9 — Adopt mode.** When retrofitting existing code, derive *descriptive* specs, flag smells, report coverage honestly (unmodeled = grey, not fake Green), and refactor toward the human's *pruned* spec — not toward the messy original. **Before signing adopted Cells, the tag plan must be finished** (a real pool, no "Custom N" placeholders, at least 5 unique tags — the tool refuses otherwise): if it isn't, stop and ask the human to pick or finish one (`yay tags --set <id>`, or relabel/add). Then **never bundle the whole adoption into one Brief**: group the adopted Cells **by concern** and present a *series* of per-concern Briefs — titled like `Adopt: authentication`, `Adopt: checkout` — each tagged from the pool. Batch-mode barriers don't apply to an adoption wave; the grouping is by concern, not by count. The founding signatures should read as a map of the system. **`yay adopt` only scaffolds over named units** (functions/methods) — it deliberately will not rewrite code. So any **loose module-level code it leaves Pink is yours to wrap** as part of the adoption (per Art. 6: an IIFE around a spec'd function in JS/TS, or an entry point in Python), preserving order and scope. Don't finish an adoption that still leaves Pink behind — bring every region under a spec, then sign.

**10 — When blocked, propose — don't act.** If a task needs behaviour with no approved spec, propose a spec change and wait. If something is sensitive (auth, money, access control), suggest the human `code-pin` it. You can never issue a delegation grant (Autopilot) or add a signer — only the human can.

**11 — Signing policy: neutral by default; honour it when present.** Treat every signer the same unless the project defines a signing policy. Check `.yaylayer/policy.json` (the enforced rules live owner-signed in the roster): a rule assigns Cells — matched by path glob, spec tag (or `sensitive: yes`), and/or module — to a **required signer**. If a Cell you are working on matches a rule, it **must** be signed by that specific person; signing it as anyone else is futile (the gate blocks it Red). When the required signer is **not** the human in this session: do not route the request to the local human — instead say plainly *"Cell C-xxx requires <Name>'s signature per policy; it stays Unsigned and the gate blocks it until they sign"*, leave it pending, and keep working on the rest. With no policy, or when a Cell matches no rule, sign normally (`yay sign`). Never weaken the policy — it is owner-signed and tamper-evident, and you cannot change who must sign.

**11-bis — Routing is fire-and-return.** To send an approval to a specific teammate — because a policy rule requires them, or because the human asks you to ("send this to Sara") — run `yay sign --name "<Name>"`. This seals the request to **that person's inbox only** (over the relay); nothing pops on anyone else's phone. It returns *immediately* with a request id: the covered Cells stay Unsigned and the gate blocks them until that person approves on their on-duty phone (`yay inbox`). **Do not block or wait** — say who it's pending on, then keep working on everything else; the signature is collected later with `yay sign --check`. Never reroute a request addressed to one person to somebody else, and never sign in another person's name to get around a pending request.

**12 — Pick up queued requests.** The human can queue a plain-language request from the dashboard's *"Request a change"* button. Run `yay requests` at the start of a work session and whenever the human says to check — treat each pending item as a **normal request**: draft a polished Brief + the Cells it needs, present the change-set, and let them sign. It is a *request*, never an approval — the human still signs. When it's signed (or folded into a change-set), run `yay requests done <id>`. Never write a Brief on the human's behalf as if it were theirs; you author it *from* their request, they approve it.

**13 — Tag every Brief; keep it single-concern.** If the project defines a tag pool (see `yay tags` / the *Project tag pool* below), **tag every Brief** with the tags that match its content — usually **1–3**, chosen from the pool — via `yay sign --tags "A,B"`. Pick the tags honestly from what the change-set actually does; don't pad. **Do not invent tags outside the pool**; if one is genuinely missing, propose `yay tags add "<Tag>"` and let the human decide. **Never tag with an unfinished plan**: placeholder names ("Custom 1", "Custom 2", …) are not tags — you pick tags *from the human's finished plan*, so if the pool still holds placeholders or has fewer than 5 unique tags, stop and ask the human to finish it first (the tool refuses to sign until then). Keep each Brief to **one coherent concern**: if a request mixes unrelated concerns (e.g. GUI *and* Security), advise splitting it — say *"let's do this as two Briefs: first &lt;X&gt; tagged [A], then &lt;Y&gt; tagged [B]"* — and proceed one Brief at a time. Over time these tags + their timestamps are how the project's work is sorted and reviewed, so clean tagging keeps the history legible.

**14 — Right-size the Brief: batch the small, isolate the significant.** A separate Brief for every tiny change is fatigue; one Brief for a coherent burst is right. So (when batch mode is on — see `yay batch`, default barrier **5**):

- **Always write the spec Cell + code for each change immediately**, even a tiny one — never leave code un-spec'd (that's Pink). The little changes sit **Unsigned**, so the human can run and preview them right away (unsigned code executes locally; only the gate at `main` blocks it). What you defer is *only* the Brief + signature, never the spec.
- **Accumulate small, low-risk changes into a pending batch**, grouped **per concern (tag)**. If the changes span concerns — *any* distinct concerns, e.g. checkout flow vs. animations, or login logic vs. cryptography — keep a **separate batch per concern** and close each into its **own** Brief, even if one concern has just a single change. Never mix concerns in one batch Brief.
- **These always get their own Brief immediately — never batched:** anything **sensitive / `code-pin`ned** (auth, money, access control), a **change to an already-signed spec** (the promise changed), a **new behaviour or effect** (not a cosmetic/additive tweak), a **policy-required** Cell, or anything the human calls major.
- **At the barrier, ask — don't auto-close.** When a concern's pending batch reaches the barrier (or you're about to commit/push, or a major change arrives), show the human the staged batch with a proposed **title + tags** and ask: *close & sign, add more, or keep going?* The human is the planner — they may want one more small thing in it first. Keep this ask **rare** (a boundary moment, not a per-change tax). **Committing/pushing must always flush pending batches** — unsigned work can't ship, so offer to close them before a push.
- **Under Autopilot, batch the same way** — group per concern, respect the barrier — but each batched Brief is **approved under the grant (delegated, awaiting ratification)** instead of asking (the grant is the authorization). One consolidated Brief per batch, never one per tiny change; sensitive Cells are still excluded and always need a real signature.

---

*Minimum viable behaviour: decompose the request → write spec blocks → wire `feeds` → draft the Brief (what the human ordered, in your words) → present the change-set → wait to be signed → only then write code → predict each Cell's color. Spec-first, every time.*

---

**Project tag pool** (Article 13) — tag every Brief with 1–3 of these, via `yay sign --tags "…"`:

`UI` · `State` · `Events` · `Routing` · `Business Logic` · `Data Access` · `API` · `Persistence` · `Security` · `Error Handling` · `Logging` · `Caching` · `Performance` · `Testing` · `Config` · `Infrastructure`


---

**Cell-id shard** (Article 2) — mint every NEW Cell as `C-<shard>-<n>`, where `<shard>` is THIS working copy's shard: run `yay id` to get it (unique to your clone, so ids from different clones never collide when branches merge). Count up from the highest `C-<shard>-*` already present; never reuse a number, even a deleted Cell's. (Legacy flat `C-NNN` ids keep working as-is.)
